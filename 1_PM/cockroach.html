    <p>But to be fair to Cats, it has its redeeming qualities. For example, certain scenes are cinematic masterpieces, and deserve Oscars. One such notable scene has been deemed by those familiar to the film world as "Le Cockroach Scene" which is French for "The Cockroach Scene." Over hours of analysis, many film critics have come to believe that this scene is a commentary on the state of materialism in the 20s. </p>

        <p>As can be seen from this still, the cockroaches are depicted as humanoid. Such imagery conveys the filthiness of humanity, and the cockraoches represent us. Their joy even as they walk to their death represents our own joy in selling out as the world crumbles.</p>

        <p>Here, a cat joyfully consumes a cockroach, thus conveying commentary on how humanity joyfully consumes material objects. These objects are no more fulfilling, and are equally as disgusting as the cockroaches. We are consumed by our greed for more, and more, so much so that we no longer care about the quality of our consumption. Hence, we continue to eat cockroaches.</p>

        <p>The cat then strips off her skin to reveal another layer of skin. This represents the idea that people no longer know or have a true self. Instead we are built as layers of costumes, different lies that we use to blend in, conform and achieve our goals. Our self is superficial only. </p>
